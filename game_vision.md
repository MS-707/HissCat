# üéÆ HissCat - Game Vision Document

---

## üß° Core Concept

HissCat is a 2D bullet heaven, roguelite-inspired iOS game that tells the playful, heartfelt story of a brave tabby cat facing waves of quirky enemies.  
It is a tribute to a real cat named Gus, and must always preserve a tone of warmth, energy, and emotional vibrancy.

## üé® Visual and Emotional Style

- Art Style: Lightweight pixel/2D art with slight polish (clean, charming, retro-modern hybrid)
- Tone: Heartfelt, whimsical, cozy, playful
- Emotional Impact: Player should feel joy, slight tension, rising empowerment
- Animation: Natural, soft (no horror, no grotesque violence)

## ‚ö° Core Gameplay Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Movement** | Smooth 8-directional (WASD/touchstick) top-down movement |
| **Scaling Chaos** | As time progresses, more enemies spawn, faster and harder |
| **Passive Attack Evolution** | Player grows stronger automatically by collecting treats |
| **Screen-Filling Action** | In later stages, gameplay becomes chaotic but readable |
| **Short "One More Run" Sessions** | Each game session should be self-contained and replayable |

## üõ°Ô∏è Design Guardrails

- All attack systems must support passive triggering (no heavy manual combat reliance).
- Player upgrades must scale aggressively over time.
- Visual effects must enhance gameplay clarity, not obscure it.
- Enemies should pose escalating threat, but never cause player frustration from unfairness.
- Controls must feel immediately responsive and intuitive on iOS touchscreens.

---

## üéØ MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Goals

- Player can move and attack.
- Enemies can spawn and chase.
- Player can collect simple powerups.
- Gameplay loop: survive as long as possible against endless waves.

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Expansion Notes

- Expand enemy types with different movement/attack patterns.
- Procedural/randomized elements to make every run unique.
- Passive build systems (player selects upgrades over time like Vampire Survivors).
- Unlockable skins, music tracks, or bonus modes based on performance.

---

## üß† Developer and AI Reminders

- Always prioritize smooth gameplay feel over visual excess.
- Always ensure player feels stronger with progression, not just surviving.
- Maintain the emotional core: Gus‚Äôs memory is about life, spirit, and joy.
- Build modularly: every major system should be independently upgradeable.
